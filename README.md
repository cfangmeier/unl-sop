SOP for CMS Forwardpixel Phase-I manufacturing at UNL
=====================================================

This repository holds the standard operating procedures (SOP) for use in the silcon lab at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Feel free to use them at other sites as well.

Instructions to create documents
--------------------------------

The SOP documents are written in LaTeX. You will need a current LaTeX distro to make those files. A `Makefile' is procided at your convenience.

If everything is properly set up, do

```
make -j4
'''
and the pdf files should appear shortly.

Documentation templates
-----------------------
Some SOP come with a txt-file, which should be used to document the work done using that SOP. Use them as a template in an editor of your choice and upload it to the elog.

Signed-off documents
