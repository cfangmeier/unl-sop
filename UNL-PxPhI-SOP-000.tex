\maketitle

%-------------------------------------------------------
\section{Scope}
The high energy physics group at University of Nebraska-Lincoln hosts one of the two US manufacturing sites for sensor modules to be used in the upgraded CMS forward pixel detector. Most of the activities are carried out in the lab (room JH~174) and the cleanroom inside there (room JH~174C).

%-------------------------------------------------------
\section{Purpose}
This document and the herein listed subdocuments describe the procedures in place to manufacture modules to high standards and principles to assure their quality.

%-------------------------------------------------------
\section{Definitions}
The definitions defined here apply to all subdocuments as well.
\begin{description}
    \item[BBM] \emph{Bare bump-bonded module.} Consists of a silicon sensor and 16 ROC, attached through bump bonding.
    \item[HDI] \emph{High-Density Interconnect}. Flexible circuit board providing connection from the ROC to the data acquisition systems. Contains a TBM
    \item[ROC] \emph{Read Out Chip.} Chips attached to the sensors using bump bonding. Every pixel of the sensor is attached to an individual amplifier/comparator circuit on the ROC, which orchestrates the readout of signals for all pixels covered by one ROC.
    \item[TBM] \emph{Token Bit Manager.} Chip to control the readout of ROC in a module and providing interfaces to the outer world. Normally part of an HDI.
\end{description}

%-------------------------------------------------------
\section{Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The head of operations is responsible to maintain the SOP documents current, organizes the proper training and makes sure all members of the team follow the SOP.
\end{itemize}
TODO: We should probably add an orgchart here and list some key people.

%-------------------------------------------------------
\section{Document hierarchy}
The documents are organised in a hierarchical way, as outlined by Fig.~\ref{fig:SOPhierarchy}.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=16cm]{img/SOPhierarchy.pdf}
        \caption{Hierachy of SOP documents. The three-digit number identifies documents and the first digit assigns it to a class.}
        \label{fig:SOPhierarchy}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Documents are identified by a 3-digit number. The top-level document has the number 000. All the other documents carry numbers different from this. The first digit identifies the group the document belongs to, see figure.

\subsection{Versioning of documents}
Any SOP document carries a revision number, consisting of the letter `v' followed by a number. `v0' identifies a draft document. Any document `v1' and above is effective as of the date printed.

\subsection{Referencing documents}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cross-reference within SOP documents go as SOP~XXX, where XXX is the document number. This assumes a reference to the latest version of that document. References to specific version are to be avoided.
\item Referencing from external documents should use the full title and SOP number.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{List of documents}
Table \ref{tbl:SOPlist} shows the planned documents. They do not need to be in place before this document becomes v1. A list of all current documents is to be maintained and made accessible to all people involved.

\section{Production life-cycle and critical control points}

The standard workflow is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:WorkflowProduction}. Any normal module fulfilling all quality criteria will follow the standard path. Module quality is tested along the production path. Every such test defines a \emph{critical control point}. Modules failing the quality criteria will be judged for reworking or will be classified as bad.

TODO: Acceptance criteria or specifications will soon be available in a centrally managed TWiki page. We will link to this and also take note of the change control procedure there.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=12.7cm]{img/WorkflowProduction.pdf}
        \caption{Standard workflow for production of modules at UNL. Solid paths show the steps all modules will undertake. Dashed paths are optional steps, based on needs (reworking if quality criteria not matched) or additional tests (according to testing schemes. Critical control points are shown as circles. Numbers refer to SOP documents.).}

    \end{center}
\end{figure}

%-------------------------------------------------------
\section{Documentation of workflow, test results and maintenance operations}
Any action following procedures covered by this set of SOP need to be documented as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item All activities need to be documented on the UNL logbook
\item Any activity that produces results or processes parts (raw, intermediate or finished) requires an update in the Purdue database
\end{itemize}
See the resources section for links.

\subsection{Identification of parts and batches}
\begin{itemize}
    \item BBM and complete modules are identified using the naming convention (see resources section).
    \item To identify an HDI (as of RevC), three numbers are required:
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Work order (\texttt{AAANN} where \texttt{AAA} are alphanumeric digits, \texttt{NN} are numeric digits)
	\item Date code (\texttt{WWYY} where \texttt{WW} is the week of the year and \texttt{YY} is the year)
	\item Panel and position number (\texttt{NNMM} where \texttt{NN} is the panel number processed (add a leading zero if necessary) and \texttt{MM} is the position of the HDI on the panel)
    \end{itemize}
    This makes up the following unique id for an HDI: \texttt{AAANN-WWYY-NNMM}

    Other information on an HDI can be safely disregarded. An example is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:HDI_SN}.
    \item A batch at UNL is identified using a six-digit number of the format \texttt{Nxxxyy} where
    \begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{N} identifies a batch number, N standing for Nebraska
	\item \texttt{xxx} is a three-digit number with leading zeroes identifying the group of modules within the batch, \texttt{001} referring to the first batch etc.
	\item \texttt{yy} is a two-digit number with leading zero identifying the individual modules inside a batch
    \end{itemize}
    Example: \texttt{N00403} is module \texttt{03} of batch \texttt{004}

    The list of batch numbers is maintained in a spreadsheet, see the resources section.
    \item The HDI id is the final and official identifier. The batch number is for internal use by UNL for internal convenience. It allows to identify modules made within the same batch, share the same tools, and has an easier to communicate structure of only numbers plus one character.
\end{itemize}

        \includegraphics[width=7cm]{img/HDIRevD_id.png}
        \caption{\textbf{Example to identify an HDI (RevD):} ID of this HDI would be \texttt{YHC69-1015-0311}, meaning work order \texttt{YHC69}, manufactured in week 10 of year 2015, third panel processed in this batch, and this is HDI from position 11 of that panel. All other information can be safely disregarded, especially the number \texttt{30598} (which is an internal cage code used by the manufacturer).}
        \label{fig:HDI_SN}

All other information can be safely disregarded, especially the number \texttt{30598} (which is an internal cage code used by the manufacturer).}

%-------------------------------------------------------
\section{Training}
\begin{itemize}
\item Only trained staff members are allowed to perform actions described in the SOP.
\item Training normally consists of instruction by the responsible supervisor or another trained staff member.
\item Documentation: Training status needs to be documented using form \texttt{SOP-000-Form-01} and kept on records with the responsible.
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------------------
\section{Deviations from SOP}
Two cases need to be distinguished:
\begin{description}
    \item[Planned deviations] This can happen e.g.~upon special request to study certain changes to the procedures or due to specific circumstances (supplier issues, material changes etc.). Before starting the procedure, a written document needs to be signed off. In this document, the following topics need to be addressed: foreseen deviation, reason for doing so, risk assessment. Local site responsible persons decide if they can take over the responsibilities, otherwise sign-off needs to happen by project management.
    \item[Unforeseen deviations] This can happen when a special condition required a deviation. Such cases need to be documented within ample time by the person observing the deviation and require sign-off by a site responsible. The latter decide if special action is required and decide if project management needs to be informed about the deviation.
\end{description}
